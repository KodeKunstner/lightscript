<h2>FScriptME</h2>







<a name="link0"></a><h4>What is FScriptME?</h4>

<p>FScriptME is an implementation of FScript designed for Java Micro Edition.
See the Sun J2ME <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2me">site</a>
.
Currently FScriptME is still in beta, in that it has only recently been released
and is still relatively untested.  However it is based upon the FScript
source code and as such should be stable.</p>

<p>I am currently using FScriptME to develop a scripting environment for the 
Palm platform using <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/midp4palm/index.html">
MIDP for Palm</a>
, this is still unreleased but the FScript
section was considered mature enough for independent release.</p>



<a name="link1"></a><h4>How does FScriptME differ from FScript?</h4>

<p>A number of changes were made to FScriptME to enable it to work with J2ME,
some of these changes are due to the restrictions of J2ME and some are to keep 
the code base simpler (and therefore smaller). The main changes are:
<ul>
<li>Double values are not supported</li>

<li>FScript extensions are not supported</li>

<li>The BasicIO class is not available</li>

<li>ArrayLists are replaced by Vectors in FScript methods</li>

<li>FScript's <i>run</i>
 method has been renamed to <i>runCode</i>
 so subclasses
can be made Runnable</li>

<li>Only the <i>elseif</i>
 keyword is supported not the optional <i>elsif</i>
 that is supported in fscript</li>

<li>A new keyword <i>exit</i>
 has been added that allows scripts to exit (somewhat like return, but terminating script execution), <i>exit</i>
 takes a parameter that is returned from the top level calling method (in FScript) e.g. <i>runCode</i>
.  A corresponding <i>exit</i>
 method has been added to the <i>FScript</i>
 class, to allow functions implemented in subclasses to also <i>exit</i>
 correctly.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>This document does <b>not</b>
 contain FScript information (syntax, usage etc.),
download FScript proper from the 
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/fscript">homepage</a>
 and use the 
existing FScript documentation (as FScript and FScriptME are very similar).</p>



<a name="link2"></a><h4>Why GPL?</h4>

<p>FScript was originally developed for inclusion in a commercial product, hence
the choice of the LGPL.  As FScriptME has no such restrictions I have chosen
to release it under GPL.  This does mean that FScriptME may <b>not</b>
 be used
as part of a commercial product. <i>However</i>
 I am open to relicensing on 
a product by product basis, please contact me (murlen no-spam at users dot
sourceforge dot net) if this may be of interest to you.</p>
