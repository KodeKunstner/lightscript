### DESCRIPTION ###

This is the java implementation of Sol and MobyScript.
Sol is a minimalistic stack oriented language / virtual machine.
MobyScript is an EcmaScript-like scripting language for 
mobile devices implemented on top of Sol.

The sol virtual machine consists of two parts which are just builtin classes:
	'java.util.Stack' 	for parameter passing.
	'java.util.Hashtable' 	for global values.

Functions extends the class 'Function', which just requires that they
has an 'apply'-method which works on the stack. This is an abstract class
rather than an interface to make the dynamic dispatch faster. 



### CLASSES ###

Replacable main class:
	Sol		test class with main function

Core Sol language:
	Function	interface for executable functions
	Globals		functions for global values including parser
	Code		user defined functions
	Builtin		various builtin functions
	Immediate	function that push a datum

MobyScript:
	MobyCode	Sol-code with argc and none/single return value.
