	{\large 
            Problem
	\\ \mbox{}}
	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{10mm}
            \item Scripting languages are very limited, or not existing, on low-end mobile phones
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{3mm}
            \item Mobile platforms are heterogenous
            \item Low end phones have very limited resources, especially with regard to code footprint
            \item Run time loading of programs is generally not possible
            \item Development targeting low-end phones is not very expressive
	\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
	{\large 
            Goal
	\\ \mbox{}}
	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{2mm}
            \item A scripting language running well on very low-end phones
            \item Loading of scripts as source code at run time
            \item Expressive
            \item Embeddable
            \item Portable
            \item Low code footprint and decent performance
            \item A practical tool
	\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
\begin{slide}
	{\large 
            Approach
	\\ \mbox{}}
	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{5mm}
            \item Bottom up, incremental development
            \item A series of prototypes: parsers, compilers, virtual machines, \\ a Forth dialect, experiments with mobile programming, \\ \emph{Yolan}, \emph{LightScript}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize} 
\setlength{\itemsep}{3mm}
            \item Standard Java classes for built in types: hashtables, stacks, ...

                %Still practical when code footprint is critical
            \item Interesting for benchmarking, and due to tiny code footprint $\approx$~5KB

        \item Piggybacking on JavaScript/EcmaScript
	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
            \item Runs in existing implementations, including interpreters and web browsers in smartphones
            \item Mainstream language, familiar for existing developers, web developers and advanced users
            \item \emph{Keep:} first class functions, closures, static scope, objects, prototypical inheritance, object/array-literals, exceptions, ...
            \item \emph{Skip:} regular expressions, floats, with, eval, switch, typeof, type coerced equality, large parts of standard library, ...

%	\\ \mbox{}
        }
	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
            \item There are now practical scripting languages running on the lowest end mobile phones
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{-2mm}
            \item LightScript can be used to cross the gaps between the heterogenous platforms, as it is targeted low-end phones, and it also runs on high end mobile devices by subsetting EcmaScript
            \item Yolan and LightScript support execution of source code loaded at runtime
            \item LightScript is expressive, having closures, prototypical objects, array and object literals, dynamic typing, ... This opens up for easier and faster development on mobile devices
