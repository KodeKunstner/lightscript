\section{NO C IMPLEMENTATION YET}
Intended/future Features of the compact C implementation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Suitable for embedded devices, does not depend on any external libraries
\item 16 bit per data word in the scripting language to reduce run time memory requirements
\item Garbage collected, fixed size heap for internal data, max 128KB
\end{itemize}
