- Introduction
  - Speech structure
    - Introduction: goal, mobile landscape
    - Body
  - The mobile landscape
    - Phones vs. smartphones
    - Java Micro Edition 
    - Scripting languages
  - Goal: A scripting language that runs on low-end mobile phones
    - portable, embeddable, low memory footprint
    - expressiveness - first class functions, easy use of maps and stacks
    - loading of scripts at run time
    - a practical tool

  - Approach
    - bottom up, incremental developement
    - series of prototypes: parsers, compilers, virtual machines, forth dialects, mobile experiments, Yolan, LightScript
    - research, reimplement, reevaluate, repeat
    - direction kept in mind -- EcmaScript-like language for mobile devices
- Body
  - Yolan
    - Runs on CLDC 1.0+
    - Has standard Java classes for built in types, support for hashtables, stacks, ...
    - Scripts can be loaded as source code at run time
    - Functions are first class values
    - Fast variable access. Online execution
    - Integer only. Single false value 
  - Yolan
    - Lazy Java interface
    - Lisp like syntax. Dynamic scoping
    - Evaluation by walking through the syntax tree. Simple optimisations at execution time. Single class.
    - Sets the bar for code footprint $\approx$ 5KB
    - A stepping stone / pilot plant for LightScript
  - LightScript - introduction
  - JavaScript/EcmaScript
  - Implementation
    - Imperative top down operator precedence parser
    - Compiler
    - Stack based virtual machine
  - LightScript 1.0
    - Closures, lexical scoping, subset of EcmaScript, object, prototypical inheritance, exceptions, scripts loadable at run time 
    - Code footprint $\approx$ 11KB

- Conclusion

	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{-2mm}
            \item LightScript can be used to cross the gaps between the heterogenous platforms, as it is targeted low-end phones, and it also runs on high end mobile devices by subsetting EcmaScript
            \item Yolan and LightScript support execution of source code loaded at runtime
            \item LightScript is expressive, having closures, prototypical objects, array and object literals, dynamic typing, ... This opens up for easier and faster development on mobile devices
