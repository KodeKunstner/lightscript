LightScript is a subscript of EcmaScript,
with a compact implementation running
on low end mobile devices.

./net/lightscript class files and generated Java source files,
this is what is needed when embedding the scripting language.

./src contains the actual source code, from which ./net/lightscript
is generated. Some contains CPP-directives, and is thus not directly
compilable, - use the Makefile

./doc contains documentation, and generated javadoc

./TODO to do list, and roadmap
