This is the java implementation of sol,
- a minimalistic stack oriented language. 

The virtual machine has two parts which are just builtin classes:
	'java.util.Stack' 	for parameter passing.
	'java.util.Hashtable' 	for global values.

Functions extends the class 'Function', which just requires that they
has an 'apply'-method which works on the stack. This is an abstract class
rather than an interface to make the dynamic dispatch faster. 

There are the following classes
	Sol		test class with main function
	Function	interface for executable functions
	Core		parser/compiler and functions for global values
	Code		userdefined functions
	Builtin		various builtin functions
	Immediate	function that push a datum

It is names after the fifth note, 
following the untraditions of C, C#, D and forth.
