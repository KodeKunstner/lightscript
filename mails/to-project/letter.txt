Hi Julia,

I have attached the current draft writings, notes, etc. 
It is probably only the first 4-5 "chapters" that 
are worth skimming, most of it are just drafts
and some of the remaining are only notes.

I am not content with it as a potential master thesis,
even though it has a nice result: that I make
a scripting language for mobile devices, that
has significantly smaller code footprint than any 
other scripting languages that I have been able to find.
So looking at the project, I believe that if I round it off 
it could be a decent 15-ects 2.dels-projekt ? 
and then right after that create a (smaller) master thesis
in another topic.
