Yes, though only on a basic level,

in any of them.

Makes sense, I will do that.

I will try to find some of those.

By the way, while clarifying the goals, 
the focus has shifted more towards 
mobile rather than embedded devices,
which is also why I do not use the word
embedded in the synopsis but only talk 
about limited devices.

Page numbers where the references occur. 
It is practical in longer documents, 
but should probably be omitted 
when the document is this short.

I am revising the project, and currently considering just focusing on
making a small subset/dialect of EcmaScript run on limited devices,
rather than designing a new language from scratch. That also makes it
easier to bootstrap the compiler (I want it to be able to compile itself).
It also gives more time for work on optimisation for limited devices,
type inference etc.
