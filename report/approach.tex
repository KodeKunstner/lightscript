\chapter{* Approach}
\label{method}
\section{* Overall approach}
\cite{waterfall} vs. \cite{stepwise-refinement}
    - waterfall vs. stepwise refinement
\subsection{* Prototypes}
    - approx 30 partial prototypes
\section{* Design choices}
    - null is false -- Lua HOPL-3 paper reference!
    - scope: lightscript static, yolan dynamic
    - dynamic type system
    - building on top of jvm/cldc-1.0
    - fast variable access
    - scope: lightscript tdop, yolan trivial
    - prototypes for evaluation
    - parser robust, but not validating
    - online execution, a statement at a time
    - good integration with java - nativ objecst rather than language defined

... online... able to execute scripts larger than what can be kept in memory
GC'ing of executed code.
\section{* Evaluation}
    - code footprint
    - execution speed
\section{* Summary}
