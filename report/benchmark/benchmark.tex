\section{Code footprint}
To compare the code footprint size, I have added an estimate of the jar file size. 
The estimate is done by making a zip archive of the non-obscurified class files,
trying to exclude class files that are part of extra libraries.
The motivation for this approach is that some of the languages have large GUI libraries,
which would count against them, if we just looked at the jar file. 
In addition, compilation of some of the languages is obscurified/optimised by default,
which would give those an advantage. So this should give a more fair comparison.
As a rule of thumb with classfiles, the compressed files are approximately half the size of original.
