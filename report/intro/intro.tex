\chapter{Introduction}

The main focus will be on making a scripting language, that runs on devices with hard memory limitations.

To reduce the complexity of the project, the following features will have low or no priority:
\begin{itemize}
\item Execution speed. This is a scripting language for configuration and application logic. Computationally intensive code should be optimised into a more low-level language.
\item Strict syntax checking etc. As a subset of EcmaScript, with some extra library functions, most syntax can be debugged using existing tools. More checking would enlargen the compiler, which would use more memory on the device.
\end{itemize}
