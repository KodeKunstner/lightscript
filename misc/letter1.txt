subject: Master thesis supervision

Hi Julia,

would you be interested in
supervising my master thesis?

The learning goals are going to be in the
direction of programming on limited devices and
programming language design and implementation.

The topic will be to make a scripting language
which works across the heterogeneous platforms of
embedded/mobile devices and script-enabled web browsers.
This is both practical as a tool,
and also as a focus for exploration
of programming language theory.

I have looked a bit into it,
and I have some literature and ideas in place.
Perhaps we could arrange a meeting
to discuss it further?

I hope that you are interested,
as I think that you would probably be
the best supervisor at diku for this project.

Best regards,
   Rasmus
